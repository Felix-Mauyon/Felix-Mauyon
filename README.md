# Hiya👋
<br />


I'm **Felix**, a Computer Science major at Kibo School of Technology with passion for programming. The transformation of code into applications that influence people's lives fascinates me. Proficient with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python and experienced with frameworks like Flask. Just finished contributing to an Open Source project called Oppia and also learning React so I can build more exciting projects this year!
<br />

### Projects

- [Afrolodge](https://afrologde-com.onrender.com/): Afrologe is an app that aims to connects hosts who offer short-term accommodation options with travelers seeking accommodations. It was built with HTML, CSS and Python Flask

- [BookShelf](https://bookshelf-mbnb.onrender.com): This app helps you manage your books, like a digital library. It provides the basic CRUD functionality that allows users to add, update, delete books.The app is built with Flask.

- [OP Portfolio Site](https://felix-mauyon.github.io/OP-Portfolio-site/#):
This is a mock portfolio website for a team of software engineers. The site is built with HTML, BootStrap CSS and JavaScript

- Log Analyzer: This script processes log files to generate statistical reports for test results. It calculates the number of executed tests, counts descriptions containing 'component', identifies the most used test type, and counts failures per test type. Built with Python.

- Directory Maintainer: This python script organizes a messy backlog of files by categorizing them into specific folders based on their file extension. It moves .csv, .log, and .txt files into corresponding folders and handles log retention and large text files according to specified thresholds.

- Microprocessor Simulation: This script simulates a microprocessor performing operations like add, mul, gt, or, nand, min, shift, and noop on integer inputs based on a given program. It processes each operation, outputs the result, and handles invalid operations gracefully. It was made with Python.

**P.S: The Log Analyzer, Directory Maintainer and Microprocessor Simulation are private projects from Kibo School of Technology**
